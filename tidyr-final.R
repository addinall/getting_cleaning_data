# Append two more function calls to accomplish the following:
#
# 1. Use group_by() (from dplyr) to group the data by part and
# sex, in that order.
#
# 2. Use mutate to add two new columns, whose values will be
# automatically computed group-by-group:
#
#   * total = sum(count)
#   * prop = count / total
#
sat %>%
  select(-contains("total")) %>%
  gather(part_sex, count, -score_range) %>%
  separate(part_sex, c("part", "sex")) %>%
  group_by(part, sex)> %>%
  mutate(total = sum(count),
         prop = count/total
  ) %>% print
